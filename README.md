Integrated Collector Storage with Movable Insulation Layer
Overview
Welcome to the repository for my master's thesis project on an Integrated Collector Storage (ICS) system with a movable insulation layer. This innovative solar thermal collector design aims to enhance efficiency and reduce thermal losses.

Project Details
In this project, I have developed a solar thermal collector with an electronically controlled movable insulation layer. The design includes a detailed thermal model and an interactive tool for solar thermal analysis.
